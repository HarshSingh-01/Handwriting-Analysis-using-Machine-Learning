                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Handwriting Analysis or Graphology is the science of identifying, evaluating and revealing the personality of an
                    individual through patterns and strokes hidden in the handwriting. It includes examining the features such as size of
                    letters and words, spacing between the letters and words, pen pressure, margins, slant angle. Based on these features a
                    person’s traits are judged as whether he/she is an introvert or extrovert, his/her social skills, discipline, and
                    emotional stability. This paper puts forward a methodology using Machine Learning Algorithms to analyse the handwriting
                    samples since manual approach is quite expensive and error prone. The present study immensely uses OpenCV for image
                    preprocessing while sci-kit for training and testing the model. A combination of six extracted features is used to
                    output one of seven personality traits. Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been used as the classifier since it is
                    relatively more memory efficient and overcomes the problem of overfitting. Seven such classifiers were trained, one for
                    each personality trait. The classifier gave satisfactory results with 100% accuracy for some classifiers. The accuracy
                    of the classifiers may vary depending on the handwriting sample.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Graphology or Handwriting analysis is defined as the examination of the physical characteristics and handwriting
            patterns in order to understand the cognitive patterns and the state of mind of a person. The handwriting of a person is
            used to identify, evaluate, and understand the emotional state and temperament of a person [1]. Graphologists or
            Handwriting experts identify strokes, spaces, patterns, margins, pressure etc. to predict the personality traits of a
            person which are represented by neurological brain patterns. These brain patterns contribute exceptional neuromuscular
            movements which are common to everyone with the inherited personality trait [2]. These handwriting patterns reflect the
            subconscious state of mind of an individual. It is interesting to note that Graphology is different from Graph Analysis
            which deals with the examination of the forensic documents.
            <p>Graphology finds its applications in various fields including education, job applications and medical sciences. It has
            found great opportunities in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s and Kanfer’s test for the detection of
            cancer.</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an automated approach of analyzing the handwriting of a person. This method is faster, meticulous
            and economical to use as compared to the conventional manual approach which is tedious, expensive and error prone.</p>
