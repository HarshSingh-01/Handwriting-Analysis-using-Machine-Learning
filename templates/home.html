                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Handwriting Analysis or Graphology is the science of identifying, evaluating and revealing the personality of an
                    individual through patterns and strokes hidden in the handwriting. It includes examining the features such as size of
                    letters and words, spacing between the letters and words, pen pressure, margins, slant angle. Based on these features a
                    personâ€™s traits are judged as whether he/she is an introvert or extrovert, his/her social skills, discipline, and
                    emotional stability. This project puts forward a methodology using Machine Learning Algorithms to analyse the
                    handwriting samples since manual approach is quite expensive and error prone. The present study immensely uses OpenCV
                    for image preprocessing while sci-kit for training and testing the model.</p>

            <h2>Graphology</h2>
            <p>Graphology or Handwriting analysis is defined as the examination of the physical characteristics and handwriting
            patterns in order to understand the cognitive patterns and the state of mind of a person. The handwriting of a person is
            used to identify, evaluate, and understand the emotional state and temperament of a person. Graphologists or Handwriting
            experts identify strokes, spaces, patterns, margins, pressure etc. to predict the personality traits of a person which
            are represented by neurological brain patterns. These brain patterns contribute exceptional neuromuscular movements
            which are common to everyone with the inherited personality trait. These handwriting patterns reflect the subconscious
            state of mind of an individual.</p>

        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Personal Relationships</strong></p>
            <p>Handwriting is analyzed to check compatibility in all types of personal relationships. Where family members are
            incompatible or find themselves in situations of conflict, an analysis of their handwritings will highlight the areas
            where personality clashes occur.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><strong>In Education</strong></p>
                <p>Handwriting Analysis is valuable in the field of education and in the counselling of students. It is particularly useful
                where interaction between teachers and pupils or between the pupils themselves is problematic.</p>
                <p>
                Children under-achieve because of low self-esteem and other personality problems. An analysis of handwriting can help us
                to discover and encourage latent skills or talents that might have gone unnoticed.
</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><strong>Job Applications</strong></p>
                <p>For job seekers handwriting analysis provides an added bonus in that it requires no painful or embarrassing interviews
                which a sensitive candidate is likely to see as an invasion of privacy.
                </p>
                <p>Because of nervousness, an otherwise perfectly qualified applicant may not be able to do justice to an interview. As a
                result, the employer may end up with a completely incorrect assessment of the applicant's suitability for the post.</p>
